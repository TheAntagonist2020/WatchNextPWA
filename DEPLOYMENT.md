## GitHub Pages Deployment

GitHub Pages is the easiest way to deploy if your code is already on GitHub.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select your branch (usually `main`)
   - Select folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for deployment**:
   - GitHub will show a message: "Your site is ready to be published at..."
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for the build to complete
   - Refresh the page to see the published URL

4. **Your app is live!**
   - URL format: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/WatchNextPWA/`
   - Example: `https://TheAntagonist2020.github.io/WatchNextPWA/`

### Updating Your Deployment:

Simply push new commits to your repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update app"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy within 1-2 minutes.

## Testing on Local Network

Want to test on your phone before deploying? Connect to the same Wi-Fi:

1. **Find your computer's local IP**:
   ```bash
   # Mac/Linux:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   
   # Windows:
   ipconfig
   ```

2. **Start local server**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Access from phone**:
   - Connect phone to same Wi-Fi as computer
   - Open browser and go to: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`

**Note**: Service workers won't work on local IP (need HTTPS), but you can still test the app functionality.
